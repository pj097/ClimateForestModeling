\section{ECMWF Reanalysis v5 Data}

The ECMWF Reanalysis v5 (ERA5) data (\cite{era5}) is a well-suited choice for correlating with tree genus classification due to its comprehensive and high-resolution climate data, including variables such as temperature, precipitation, and soil moisture. This dataset provides detailed historical weather information, capturing both spatial and temporal variations that are crucial for understanding the environmental conditions affecting tree growth and distribution. By leveraging ERA5 data, this study aimed to gain insights into how different climate factors might influence the abundance of various tree genera.
