Variety of tree species are crucial in reducing the vulnerabilities and offering stable ecosystem functioning. The precise quantification and assessment of existing tree species on global-scale is therefore essential in filling the science-policy gaps by providing key insights essential in promoting the success of natural climate solutions and devising effective climate mitigation policies. To this end, this study aims to develop novel deep learning based algorithms by using the multi-temporal multi-spectral imagery to generate large-scale forest/tree species classification maps.
