title={{EU-Forest, a high-resolution tree occurrence dataset for Europe}},
journal={Scientific Data},

volume={4},
number={1},
pages={160123},
abstract={We present EU-Forest, a dataset that integrates and extends by almost one order of magnitude the publicly available information on European tree species distribution. The core of our dataset ({\textasciitilde}96{\%} of the occurrence records) came from an unpublished, large database harmonising forest plot surveys from National Forest Inventories on an INSPIRE-compliant 1{\thinspace}km{\texttimes}1{\thinspace}km grid. These new data can potentially benefit several disciplines, including forestry, biodiversity conservation, palaeoecology, plant ecology, the bioeconomy, and pest management.},
